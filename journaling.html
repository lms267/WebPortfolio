<h3>Journaling Excercises</h3>
<img src="images/journal.jpg" alt="journal" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

<p>If you already regularly journal, then you are one step ahead! However, if
journaling is not something that you regularly practice, there is never a bad time 
to start!</p>
<p>The first step is to get a journal. The world is your oyster: you could buy a regular
old spiral notebook and a pen, you could use your iPad and Apple Pencil and keep a digital notebook, or you could 
buy a notebook with different journaling excercises already in them! If your journal doesn't have pre-prepared prompts,
here are some ideas:</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>What are five things you want to accomplish by this time next year?</li>
    <li>What is something you are currently saving up for, and why is it important to you?</li>
    <li>What are your biggest strengths? How can you use them to achieve your goals?</li>
    <li>What are your non-negotiables in life? In relationships? At work? At home?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>These are just some examples, feel free to let your thoughts flow on their own! Once, you get into a flow, you can journal
for hours, and it can be very freeing. Emotions can get bottled up very easily, so be sure to release them every now and then!
