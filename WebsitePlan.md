This website is meant to be a safe space for all service workers. This can include servers and waitstaff, nurses, cashiers/retail staff, and
anyone else who spends most of their time catering to others on a daily basis, especially with long hours that involve being on their feet for a considerable amount of time. I have found, both from anecdotal and personal experience, 
that burnout is incredibly common and it is easy to forget to take care of yourself when you spend so much time worrying about others.
This is my attempt to combat that and allow people to put themselves first, even if its just for an hour each evening. Since I am not
obtaining a career in anything graphic or digital, I wanted to make this more of a fun little project for myself, and this is an idea
I have been debating with for quite some time. My mom was the one who intially came up with the idea, and she inspired me to go through with it. I hope you enjoy, especially if this website applies to you (and even if it doesn't!).
