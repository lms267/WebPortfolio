<h3>Treat Yourself to a Hot Cup of Tea</h3>
<img src="tea.jpg" alt="cup of tea" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>
There is truly nothing more relaxing that a nice, hot cup of your favorite tea. Some popular options
include Earl Grey, Chamomile, Chai, Hibuscus, and Ginger/Tumeric, but whatever tea you choose is
up to you! This will require:

<ul>
    <li>A mug made for hot beverages (preferably one with some fun designs!)</li>
    <li>Your choice of tea bag</li>
    <li>Hot water</li>
    <li>A stovetop or automatic kettle</li>
</ul>
If you choose to use a stovetop, grab a pot and fill it with about a mug's worth of hot water and
bring that to a boil. If you choose to use an automatic kettle, pour that same amount of water into 
the reservoir, flip the switch on, and wait until that is finished boiling. Then, fill your mug with 
the hot water and dip the bag in until it is fully submerged. Wait about five minutes, and then
enjoy! 
</p>
<p><em>Optional, but you may add either milk or sweetener to your tea!</em></p>
