<h3>Head Massages</h3>
<img src="images/head.massage.jpg" alt="head massage" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; display: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>This one does require a partner. Grab your roommate, your parent, your sibling, or whomever
    is in your vacinity with working hands! Bribe them with free food next time they come visit you at
    work, and then begin to set up your space. 
    <ul>
        <li>Find a place where you can sit down so that your partner is sitting above you (a couch/bed and floor combo
            works best!)</li>
        <li>Get yourself a pillow, blanket, and a scented candle and put on some calming music.</li>
        <li>Grab coconut oil, tea tree oil, and other scalp-safe essential oils to enhance the experience.
            Mix these into a hair-oil-concoction!</li>
        <li>Have your partner lather their hands with the oil, and get to rubbing! Focus on the areas that are causing you tension,
            and strengthen your hair all in one go!</li>
    </ul>
    This will have you so relaxed that you'll be asleep in five minutes flat. 
    Make sure your loved ones have strong hands, because you're going to be begging them for this service every night!
