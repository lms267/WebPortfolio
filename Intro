This webpage is a blog-style webpage, and is meant to be a supplemental portfolio asset. A big part of marketing
nowadays is to create an online presence in any capacity so show that you have the initiative to create a brand for
yourself. My career ambitions include merging my experience in customer service with my experience in digital marketing,
hopefully landing myself in a position on a marketing team at a service-related business. The idea of this blog is 
something I have been debating doing for a long time as a true side hustle, so this was the perfect opportunity for me
to kickstart it. Getting to not only author it but actually design the website myself as well is an added bonus.
