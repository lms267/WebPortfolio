    ourselves that we would give to others." - Christopher Germer </blockquote>

<p><em>Hi, my name is Lily Sullivan. I am 22 years old and have been working in the industry since I was 16. Every server I have ever talked
to have all said something to the tune of "I'm tired", "My body always hurts," "I feel like I never have time for myself and I'm always
working," etc. I have always flirted with the idea of a blog of this nature, and this is my attempt to remind all of my food service
workers out there: It is okay to take time for yourself! You spend your entire shifts catering to other people and making
sure that all of their needs are met, but when do you take time to think about your own needs? This is your sign to put yourself first
for once!</em></p>

    I understand that it can be tempting to cope with the stress of a job
    in other ways that are detrimental to your health, but there are ways to
    take ease your mind while also taking care of your body. Here are some
    at-home remedies that you can do alone, with a close coworker, a partner,
    or whomever you chose!</p>
