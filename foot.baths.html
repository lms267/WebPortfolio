<img src="foot-bath.jpg" alt="foot bath" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

<p>A great way to relax after being on your feet all night is with a nice epsom salt foot bath. 
This requires little to no effort on your part, and is easily reusable! There is no need to go out and
buy a fancy at-home spa kit, all you need is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A plastic bin or tub (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homedics-Controlled-Invigorating-Bubbles-Removable/dp/B000TK8RCO/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3LF0ZJ2D8Z5YV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tRxCp20Vb27sVTQffmsk966Ta_H-b2UJJ_PPaO0sTD_qzSsxnxlSae6gY4ReQjX7zdDQa9EpBtkVMXWs6okx6l0B-OjQYpaq3tlybVSJHKOnB7sb56NyKFWLlJU4v9F4ngYdZKDW02egez3EW61Sb1doLZ8bnBzFtNJbQXWa8ez0LSoLdYRHAWaelxG08TwGhaxkFv06bCaHc-Qyw-kAGAopbqx5CAOTACW_aJkWRYfyn1qjej2FVvc0RpkQpcKigCenaKq6XbGuoROVKz9t-7tT6HcOG9HJKqJMUWYdFb4.T_O6v3rNKeLN0Tkj8c8IHI28_6UGSPGP0LuBlbAKISI&dib_tag=se&keywords=plastic+tubs+for+foot+wash&qid=1731900737&sprefix=plastic+tubs+for+foot+was%2Caps%2C238&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1">Here's a Link!</a>)</li>
    <li>Epsom salt</li>
    <li>Hot water (the exact temperature is up to you)</li>
    <li>Any essential oils or scents that would enhance your experience!</li>
    <li>Optional: choose your favorite candle to add to the ambience!</li>
</ul>
<p>First, take your tub and fill it with hot water. Next, add the epsom salt and any essential oils you deem
necessary. Give that a stir so that the epsom salt is incorporated. Now, place your feet in the tub and relax!
Watch a TV show, knit, play guitar - whatever your favorite calming activity is!</p>
